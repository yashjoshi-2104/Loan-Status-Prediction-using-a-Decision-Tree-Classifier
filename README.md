# Loan-Status-Prediction-using-a-Decision-Tree-Classifier
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the status of a loan. Using a dataset of loan information, a Decision Tree Classifier is trained, evaluated, and optimized to classify loans into one of three categories: 'Fully Paid', 'Charged Off', or 'Current'.
